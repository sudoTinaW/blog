Main sort algorithms based on 2 number comparison are selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort's time complexity are O(n ^ 2). Merge sort, heap sort time complexity are` O(nlogn)`, and quick sort average time complexity is` O(nlogn)`. The sort algorithm itself is not very often asked during an interview. However, the thought extended from the sort algorithm is widely used. 

In this article, we will mainly focus on the merge and quick sort and their appliance. We will only briefly describe what other sort algorithms are.

*The main thought in this article is originated from [jiuzhang](https://www.jiuzhang.com/course/)*

##### Selection Sort: 

Find the smallest element in each iteration and put it in front of all unsorted element.

*In the inner loop `A[i]`will compare to `A[j]`*

##### Insertion Sort:

We will enlarge our sorted area one by one, and make sure the each new element will be in order in the sorted area. It is like playing poke, every time when we pick a new card (enlarge the sorted area), we will put it into the correct order to make sure all cards we have are in order.

*In the inner loop `j` will start from `i - 1` , and `A[j]`will compare to `A[j - 1]`*

##### Bubble Sort:

In each iteration, we need make sure every 2 elements closed to each other are in order. Thus in one round of iteration, we can make sure the last one is the largest.

*In the inner loop, `A[j]`will compare to `A[j + 1]` and make sure i and j will loop `A.length` times*

##### Heap Sort:

It will be described in the [Heap article](./Heap.md) 

##### Merge Sort:

Details are described in [MergeSort article](./MergeSort.md)

##### Quick Sort:

Details are described in [QuickSort article](./QuickSort.md)

#### [156. Merge Intervals](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/merge-intervals/solution)

Description:

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example :

```
Input:  [(1,3),(2,6),(8,10),(15,18)]
Output: [(1,6),(8,10),(15,18)]
```

Challenge:

O(*n* log *n*) time and O(1) extra space.

Analysis:

This question will first sort by first element. Such way, If an element cannot merge with its next closest element, it can not merge with any further elements neither. If an element can merge with its next closest element, it can be updated to a new range and continue to merge with its next element. We can also understand the way that we sort the starting point, and scan one by one to find its furthest ending point.

One more thing needs to be consider, the end point is not necessary the furthest point because we didn't sort as end point. You need to find the greater end point.

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param intervals: interval list.
     * @return: A new interval list.
     */
    public List<Interval> merge(List<Interval> intervals) {
        
        
        if(intervals == null || intervals.size() <= 1) {
            return intervals;
        }
        
        Collections.sort(intervals, new MyComparator());
        
        List<Interval> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(intervals.get(0));
        
        for(int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            Interval last = result.get(result.size() - 1);
            Interval cur = intervals.get(i);
            
            if(last.end >= cur.start) {
                last.end = Math.max(last.end, cur.end);
            }else {
                result.add(cur);
            }
            
        }
        
        return result;
        
    }
}

class MyComparator implements Comparator<Interval> {
    
    public int compare(Interval a, Interval b) {
        return a.start - b.start;
    }
}
```

#### [184. Largest Number](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/largest-number/solution)

Description:

Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

Example 1:

```
Input:[1, 20, 23, 4, 8]
Output:"8423201"
```

Notice:

Do it in O(nlogn) time complexity.

The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

Analysis:

We need to rewrite the sort's compare function to sort the array lexicographically. One detail we need to pay attention is when the largest number is 0, which means all elements are 0, the result will only return 0 not 0000...

[String `compareTo` Function](./CleanCodePractice.md)

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param nums: A list of non negative integers
     * @return: A string
     */
    public String largestNumber(int[] nums) {
        
        String[] numsInString = new String[nums.length];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            numsInString[i] = String.valueOf(nums[i]);
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(numsInString, new MyComparator());
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = 0; i < numsInString.length; i++) {
            if(numsInString[0].equals("0")) {
                return "0";
            }
            sb.append(numsInString[i]);
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
        
        
    }
}

class MyComparator implements Comparator<String> {
    
    public int compare(String a, String b) {
        return (b + a).compareTo((a + b));
    }
}
```
